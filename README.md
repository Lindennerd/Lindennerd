## Hello there! I'm Luiz Paulo Lindenmaier ðŸ‘‹

a brazilian software developer working for more than 10 years in this field
I consider myself a self-learner, and dude, I do love learning ðŸ¤“! 

I'm eager to know more about the tools I use and also to learn new cool tools that pop up every once and a while on the web.

Currently I'm working with the .Net stack on my fulltime job, but I love Node Js, Web Development, Javascript etc and I consider myself as experienced with this stack as I am with the MS stack.

Please, check out my [portifolio](https://lindennerd.vercel.app/en-Us) for more information about me.

If you wanna hire me for some job or even just chat around, feel free to email me on [gmail](mailto:lindennerd@gmail.com) or just hit me up on [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/edmound#7046)
